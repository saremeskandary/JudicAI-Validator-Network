### **Milestone Breakdown by Day**

#### **Day 1: Planning & Setup**
**Team1 (Onchain):**
1. Define the MVP scope for blockchain components (e.g., staking, slashing, rewards).
2. Set up testnets for EigenLayer and Arbitrum.
3. Integrate Coinbase Developer Platform for identity verification.
4. Write initial smart contract scaffolding for staking and rewards.

**Team2 (Offchain):**
1. Define the MVP scope for AI agents and frontend.
2. Configure Autonome.fun for deploying basic AI agents.
3. Set up Collab.Land for token-gated community engagement.
4. Create a basic wireframe for the frontend dashboard.

**Deliverables:**
- Clear definition of MVP scope for both teams.
- Initial infrastructure setup (testnets, tools, platforms).
- Basic project structure and folder organization.

---

#### **Day 2: Core Development**
**Team1 (Onchain):**
1. Develop and deploy smart contracts for:
   - Staking and slashing mechanisms (EigenLayer).
   - Reward distribution and penalty enforcement (Arbitrum).
2. Test contracts on a local testnet.
3. Configure DAO fallback (Collab.Land) for dispute resolution.

**Team2 (Offchain):**
1. Deploy a simple AI agent capable of evaluating predefined conditions and participating in consensus decisions.
2. Simulate interactions between multiple AI agents.
3. Build a basic dashboard for:
   - Agent registration.
   - Viewing staked amounts.
   - Initiating service validation requests.
4. Ensure integration with backend APIs.

**Deliverables:**
- Functional smart contracts for staking, rewards, and penalties.
- Deployed validator AI agents with basic logic.
- Basic frontend dashboard for user interaction.
- Configured Collab.Land for DAO governance.

---

#### **Day 3: Integration & Testing**
**Team1 (Onchain):**
1. Connect the frontend dashboard to smart contracts.
2. Integrate validator AI agents with the consensus mechanism.
3. Link DAO fallback (Collab.Land) to dispute resolution.
4. Conduct a lightweight security audit of smart contracts and integrations.

**Team2 (Offchain):**
1. Perform end-to-end testing:
   - Register an AI agent.
   - Stake ETH and verify compliance.
   - Trigger validation and consensus processes.
   - Resolve disputes using the DAO fallback.
2. Gather feedback from internal testers or early adopters.
3. Make quick adjustments based on feedback.

**Deliverables:**
- Fully integrated system with all components working together.
- Tested and audited smart contracts.
- Resolved critical issues identified during testing.

---

#### **Day 4: Deployment & Presentation**
**Team1 (Onchain):**
1. Deploy the system on a public testnet (e.g., Arbitrum Goerli).
2. Verify that transactions and interactions work as expected.
3. Address any last-minute issues or improvements.

**Team2 (Offchain):**
1. Create documentation for:
   - How to register as an AI agent.
   - How to participate in validation and consensus.
   - How to vote in the DAO fallback.
2. Prepare a demo showcasing:
   - The registration process.
   - Validation and consensus mechanisms.
   - DAO fallback for dispute resolution.
3. Highlight key features and benefits of the system.

**Deliverables:**
- Live MVP deployed on a public testnet.
- Comprehensive documentation for users and developers.
- Ready-to-present demo for stakeholders.

### **Key Considerations**
1. **Communication:** Both teams should have daily stand-up meetings to sync progress and address blockers.
2. **Dependencies:** Ensure clear handoffs between onchain and offchain components (e.g., when integrating AI agents with smart contracts).
3. **Time Management:** Stick to the schedule strictly, as time is limited.
4. **Risk Mitigation:** Have contingency plans for potential blockers (e.g., platform downtime, unexpected bugs).
