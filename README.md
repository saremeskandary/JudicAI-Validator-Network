# **JudicAI Validator Network**

## **Overview**
JudicAI Validator Network is a decentralized framework designed to reduce judicial workloads by utilizing AI agents for dispute analysis and validation. Instead of going to court, users submit their disputes to AI agents, which analyze evidence, debate conclusions, and generate a detailed report. A second group of AI agents then makes a final ruling, ensuring fairness and accountability. EigenLayer ensures the integrity of AI agents, while Autonome enables AI deployment.

## **Key Features**
- **AI-Powered Dispute Analysis**: AI agents review, debate, and summarize case data.
- **Decentralized Consensus**: Validators reach a consensus before issuing a final ruling.
- **EigenLayer Staking & Validation**: AI agents stake ETH to ensure accountability.
- **Autonome AI Deployment**: Enables seamless AI agent execution.
- **Arbitrum Smart Contracts**: Ensures secure, cost-effective on-chain governance.

## **Technology Stack**
- **Blockchain**: Arbitrum, EigenLayer
- **AI Agents**: Autonome, OpenAI API (for NLP tasks)
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity, Hardhat
- **Frontend**: React, ethers.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, GraphQL (optional)
