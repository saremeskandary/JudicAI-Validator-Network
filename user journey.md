### **Scenario 1: Registering an AI Agent**
1. User navigates to the frontend dashboard ->  
2. User clicks on "Register AI Agent" ->  
3. User fills out required details (e.g., agent name, role, and initial logic configuration) ->  
4. User connects their wallet and stakes a minimum amount of ETH as collateral ->  
5. Smart contract verifies the stake and registers the agent ->  
6. Confirmation message is displayed, and the agent appears in the list of registered agents.

### **Scenario 2: Initiating a Service Validation Request**
1. User logs into the dashboard ->  
2. User selects "Initiate Validation Request" ->  
3. User provides context for the validation request (e.g., case description, evidence) ->  
4. User specifies the type of validator needed (e.g., lawyer, judge, technical expert) ->  
5. System assigns the request to available AI agents based on their roles ->  
6. Agents evaluate the request and submit their judgments ->  
7. Consensus is reached among agents, and the result is displayed to the user.

### **Scenario 3: Raising an Objection**
1. User receives a decision from an AI agent ->  
2. User disagrees with the decision and clicks "Raise Objection" ->  
3. User provides a detailed description of the objection and uploads supporting evidence ->  
4. System calculates the gas cost for raising the objection ->  
5. User confirms the gas cost and submits the objection ->  
6. The objection is routed to a higher-level validator (AI or human) for review ->  
7. Validator reviews the objection and either upholds or dismisses it ->  
8. The final outcome is communicated to the user, along with any refunds or penalties.

### **Scenario 4: Participating in DAO Fallback**
1. A dispute arises that cannot be resolved by AI agents ->  
2. The system triggers the DAO fallback mechanism ->  
3. Token holders are notified and invited to vote on the resolution ->  
4. Users connect their wallets and cast their votes ->  
5. Votes are tallied using smart contracts ->  
6. The majority decision is enforced, and the dispute is resolved ->  
7. Results are recorded on-chain for transparency.

---

### **Scenario 5: Testing the System (For Developers/QA Team)**
1. Tester sets up a local testnet environment ->  
2. Tester deploys the smart contracts and initializes the system ->  
3. Tester creates multiple AI agents with predefined behaviors ->  
4. Tester simulates service validation requests and evaluates agent responses ->  
5. Tester raises objections to simulate dispute resolution ->  
6. Tester triggers the DAO fallback to ensure proper voting mechanics ->  
7. Tester documents findings and reports bugs or issues.

---

### **Scenario 6: Joining the Token-Gated Community**
1. User visits the project website ->  
2. User learns about the token-gated community managed via Collab.Land ->  
3. User acquires tokens through participation, staking, or purchasing ->  
4. User connects their wallet to Collab.Land ->  
5. User gains access to exclusive community features (e.g., governance rights, early updates) ->  
6. User participates in discussions, proposals, and voting within the community.
