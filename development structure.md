## **4-Day Hackathon Development Structure**

### **Day 1: Setup & Core Architecture**

1. **Define the Scope & Flow:**  
   - **User Flow:**  
     1. **Registration:** AI agents (both providers and validators) register by staking a token (simulated using a basic token contract).  
     2. **Service Submission:** A provider submits evidence (or a service) for validation.  
     3. **Validation:** Validator AI agents (simulated) review the submission and trigger a consensus function.  
     4. **Outcome:** If consensus is reached that conditions are met, rewards are issued; otherwise, the malicious agent is penalized.
  
2. **Project Setup:**  
   - Initialize a Git repository and project folder.
   - Set up a basic Hardhat (or Truffle) environment for smart contract development.
   - Choose a test network like Arbitrum’s testnet (or simulate using a local blockchain).

3. **Design Simple Smart Contracts:**  
   - **Registration & Staking Contract:**  
     - Allow agents to register and stake a predefined amount.
     - Use EigenLayer’s idea: simple registration interface (simulate with a basic function).
   - **Validation & Consensus Contract:**  
     - A function to submit a service/evidence.
     - A function to simulate consensus (e.g., using a simple voting mechanism among “dummy” agents).
     - Reward and penalty logic (reward distribution if approved; penalty/slashing if rejected).

### **Day 2: Smart Contract Development & Deployment**

1. **Develop Smart Contracts:**  
   - **Registration Module:**  
     - Create functions for agent registration, staking, and NFT issuance (simulate NFT with a simple identifier, inspired by Flow).
   - **Validation Module:**  
     - Develop a function to submit a service/evidence.
     - Implement a basic consensus function where “validator agents” vote (simulate with an array of votes).
     - Include reward and penalty logic (using simple balance transfers).

2. **Testing & Deployment:**  
   - Write basic unit tests (using Hardhat’s testing framework) to ensure your contracts work as intended.
   - Deploy your contracts to the chosen test network (Arbitrum testnet if possible or a local simulated network).

3. **Document Contract Interfaces:**  
   - Clearly comment your code and create a simple README with contract functions and usage instructions.

### **Day 3: Front-End & Integration**

1. **Build a Minimal Front-End:**  
   - Use a simple framework like React or even plain HTML/JavaScript.
   - **Dashboard Features:**  
     - **Registration Page:** Allow agents to register (simulate staking by calling the registration contract).
     - **Submission Page:** Enable providers to submit their evidence/service.
     - **Validation Page:** Display the simulated voting/consensus process and show the final outcome (reward or penalty).

2. **Integrate with Smart Contracts:**  
   - Use ethers.js or web3.js to interact with your deployed smart contracts.
   - Create functions in your front-end that call registration, submission, and consensus functions.

3. **Simulate AI Validator Agents:**  
   - For demo purposes, you can simulate multiple validator responses with dummy data (simulate Autonome’s deployment by having pre-set “agent” responses).
   - Display results in real time (or on refresh) showing how consensus is reached.

### **Day 4: Testing, Refinement & Presentation Preparation**

1. **End-to-End Testing:**  
   - Walk through the entire user flow on your front-end.
   - Test registration, submission, consensus simulation, reward distribution, and penalty logic.
   - Debug any issues and ensure smooth integration between the front-end and smart contracts.

2. **Polish & Final Touches:**  
   - Clean up your UI for clarity.
   - Add brief tooltips or explanations to show how sponsor technologies (EigenLayer, Autonome, Coinbase, Flow, Arbitrum) inspire your modules:
     - **EigenLayer:** Used for agent registration and staking.
     - **Autonome:** Simulated agent deployment for consensus.
     - **Coinbase:** (Optional) Mention identity verification concepts.
     - **Flow:** Inspiration for NFT issuance as proof of registration.
     - **Arbitrum:** Your deployment network for scalability.
   - Write a short demo script or presentation slides to explain your idea and the MVP.

3. **Final Testing & Demo Preparation:**  
   - Run a final round of tests.
   - Prepare a demo video or live demo walkthrough highlighting:
     - The registration process.
     - Service submission and simulated AI validation.
     - The outcome (reward or penalty) based on consensus.
