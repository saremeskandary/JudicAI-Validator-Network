## **4-Day Development Plan**

### **Day 1: Planning & Setup**
#### **Objective:** Define the MVP scope, set up infrastructure, and allocate roles.
#### **Tasks:**
1. **Define MVP Scope (2 hours):**
   - Identify core functionalities to include:
     - Registration of AI agents via EigenLayer.
     - Basic staking mechanism for validators.
     - A simplified consensus mechanism for validation.
     - DAO fallback using Collab.Land for dispute resolution.
   - Exclude non-essential features (e.g., advanced reputation systems, complex NFTs).

2. **Team Roles Allocation (1 hour):**
   - Assign roles:
     - **Blockchain Developer(s):** Focus on smart contracts (EigenLayer, Arbitrum).
     - **AI Developer(s):** Work on validator AI agent logic (Autonome.fun).
     - **Frontend Developer(s):** Build a basic dashboard for registration and voting.
     - **Community Manager:** Set up Collab.Land for governance.
     - **Product Manager:** Oversee progress, resolve blockers.

3. **Set Up Infrastructure (3 hours):**
   - Deploy testnets for:
     - EigenLayer (staking and registration).
     - Arbitrum (smart contracts for rewards/penalties).
   - Integrate Coinbase Developer Platform for identity verification.
   - Configure Autonome.fun for deploying validator AI agents.
   - Set up Collab.Land for token-gated community engagement.

4. **Daily Stand-Up Meeting (30 minutes):**
   - Sync the team, clarify goals, and address questions.

#### **Deliverables:**
- Clear definition of MVP scope.
- All tools and platforms integrated and ready for use.
- Initial project structure and folder organization.

### **Day 2: Core Development**
#### **Objective:** Develop the core components of the system.
#### **Tasks:**
1. **Smart Contract Development (4 hours):**
   - Write and deploy smart contracts for:
     - Staking and slashing mechanisms (EigenLayer).
     - Reward distribution and penalty enforcement (Arbitrum).
   - Test contracts on a local testnet.

2. **Validator AI Agent Logic (4 hours):**
   - Use Autonome.fun to deploy a simple AI agent capable of:
     - Evaluating predefined conditions.
     - Participating in consensus decisions.
   - Simulate interactions between multiple agents.

3. **Frontend Dashboard (4 hours):**
   - Build a basic dashboard for:
     - Agent registration.
     - Viewing staked amounts.
     - Initiating service validation requests.
   - Ensure integration with backend APIs.

4. **DAO Fallback Setup (2 hours):**
   - Configure Collab.Land for:
     - Token-gated access.
     - Voting on contentious cases.
   - Test voting functionality with mock data.

5. **Daily Stand-Up Meeting (30 minutes):**
   - Review progress, identify blockers, and adjust priorities.

#### **Deliverables:**
- Functional smart contracts for staking, rewards, and penalties.
- Deployed validator AI agents with basic logic.
- Basic frontend dashboard for user interaction.
- Configured Collab.Land for DAO governance.

### **Day 3: Integration & Testing**
#### **Objective:** Integrate all components and conduct thorough testing.
#### **Tasks:**
1. **Component Integration (4 hours):**
   - Connect the frontend dashboard to smart contracts.
   - Integrate validator AI agents with the consensus mechanism.
   - Link DAO fallback (Collab.Land) to dispute resolution.

2. **Testing (4 hours):**
   - Perform end-to-end testing:
     - Register an AI agent.
     - Stake ETH and verify compliance.
     - Trigger validation and consensus processes.
     - Resolve disputes using the DAO fallback.
   - Identify and fix bugs.

3. **Security Audit (2 hours):**
   - Conduct a lightweight security audit of smart contracts and integrations.
   - Address any vulnerabilities found.

4. **User Feedback Loop (2 hours):**
   - Gather feedback from internal testers or early adopters.
   - Make quick adjustments based on feedback.

5. **Daily Stand-Up Meeting (30 minutes):**
   - Discuss testing results and finalize changes for Day 4.

#### **Deliverables:**
- Fully integrated system with all components working together.
- Tested and audited smart contracts.
- Resolved critical issues identified during testing.

---

### **Day 4: Deployment & Presentation**
#### **Objective:** Deploy the MVP and prepare for presentation.
#### **Tasks:**
1. **Deployment (3 hours):**
   - Deploy the system on a public testnet (e.g., Arbitrum Goerli).
   - Ensure all components are live and accessible.
   - Verify that transactions and interactions work as expected.

2. **Documentation (2 hours):**
   - Create documentation for:
     - How to register as an AI agent.
     - How to participate in validation and consensus.
     - How to vote in the DAO fallback.
   - Include technical details for developers.

3. **Presentation Preparation (2 hours):**
   - Prepare a demo showcasing:
     - The registration process.
     - Validation and consensus mechanisms.
     - DAO fallback for dispute resolution.
   - Highlight key features and benefits of the system.

4. **Final Touches (2 hours):**
   - Address any last-minute issues or improvements.
   - Ensure the system is stable and ready for demonstration.

5. **Team Retrospective (1 hour):**
   - Reflect on what went well and what could be improved.
   - Celebrate the team's achievements!

#### **Deliverables:**
- Live MVP deployed on a public testnet.
- Comprehensive documentation for users and developers.
- Ready-to-present demo for stakeholders.

## **Key Considerations**
1. **Focus on MVP:** Prioritize essential features and defer enhancements to post-sprint phases.
2. **Collaboration:** Encourage constant communication among team members to ensure alignment.
3. **Time Management:** Stick to the schedule strictly, as time is limited.
4. **Risk Mitigation:** Have contingency plans for potential blockers (e.g., platform downtime, unexpected bugs).
